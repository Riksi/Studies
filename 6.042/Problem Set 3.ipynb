    "Another way to regard this is to consider the converse. Suppose that there is some $c \\in C$ to which no $b \\in B$ maps via $f$. But this means that for no $a \\in A$ can it be that true that $h(a) = c$ since $h(a) = f(g(a)) = f(b)$ and there is no $b$ s.t. $f(b) = c$. But since $h$ is surjective this is a contradiction meaning that $f$ must also be surjective. "

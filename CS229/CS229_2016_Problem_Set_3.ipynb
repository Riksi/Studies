    "This was one of those problems with regard to which I felt that it would have been useful to have had more problem-solving guidance. The first two parts are relatively straightforward. However there are several different ways to do the last part and it helps to have techniques for deciding how to tackle such a problem. A good problem should challenge you to think about how to deploy the knowledge and skills you have learned rather instead of requiring you to spend time thinking about the required tools. For instance it might have been helpful if there was a hint to consider trying different inequalities."
